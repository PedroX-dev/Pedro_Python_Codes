> Here, I will add my Python code that I'm creating over time.

## üíª Prerequisites

Before you start, please check that you meet the following requirements:

- You have the most recent version of `<python/pip>`
- You have the librarys installed `<os, playwright, numpy, pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup, sys, shutil, fnmatch>`
- You have a machine with `<Windows / Linux / Mac>`.
- Before use the codes, see the guides to help you `<guia / link / documenta√ß√£o_relacionada_ao_projeto>`.

  ## The Projects
> [!NOTE]
> The codes are saved in:[**Codes**](./Codes/)

> [!TIP]
> To access any code, simply click on the corresponding link below:

<br>
  
In this project, the code [**coletar_arquivos.py**](./Codes/UploadArchive/TheCode/coletar_arquivos.py/) acesses folders and subfolders from the location you defined;
In the subfolders, the code will search for a especific file (by name or extension) that the user need to definided in [**caminhos.py**](./Codes/UploadArchive/TheCode/caminhos.py/);
Then, the program will move the archive to a folder, also defined in [**caminhos.py**](./Codes/UploadArchive/TheCode/caminhos.py/).


In other words:

`Folder X -> SubFolder X -> Archive X -> Final_Folder`

To do the reverse process:

`Final_Folder -> Achive X -> Folder X -> SubFolder X`

You just need to use: [**devolver_arquivos.py**](./Codes/UploadArchive/TheCode/devolver_arquivos.py/)
